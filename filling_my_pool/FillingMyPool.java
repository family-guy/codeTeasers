/* let x = rate of the blue pipe in litres per hour, y = rate of the red pipe in litres per hour
and l = litres required to fill the pool. We have y = l/8.5, 5.25y + 5.25x = l. As y = l/8.5
<=> l = 8.5y, it follows that x = 13/21y. Thus the blue pipe is slower and the time it takes is
1/(13/21) * 17/2 = 357/26 hours */
