If I fill up my pool using my red hose pipe, it takes me eight and a half hours. If I fill it up using both my red hose pipe and my blue hose pipe, it takes just five and a quarter hours. How long will it take me to fill my pool if I used just the blue hose pipe?

(All the common sense simplifications apply: constant flow rates, don't try to complicate things with physics!)
